# Encryption-Decryption-Project-for-Micro-IT
This is my first project on GitHub about encryption and decryption of a message for Micro IT.
**ENCRYPTION** is the process of converting a plain text which is in readable format into cipher text which cannot be read.
**DECRYPTION** is the process of converting a cipher text which is in unreadable format into plain text which can be read.
In this program, I used a basic method called **SUBSTITUTION METHOD** with key size **+2**.
